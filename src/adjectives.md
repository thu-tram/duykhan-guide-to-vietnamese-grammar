Vietnamese adjectives – YourVietnamese
========================================

In this lesson, we’re going to learn about the usage of _adjectives in Vietnamese_. As the primary role of adjectives is to modify nouns, it’s quite important that you have finished the [lesson on nouns](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-nouns/) before this lesson.

### Position of Vietnamese Adjectives

If you can still recall from the lesson on Vietnamese sentence structure, you have learned that adjectives are put after the nouns they modify. For instance, _I bought this interesting book yesterday_ is translated into _I bought book interesting this yesterday_.

Example:

Original English sentenceI bought this interesting book yesterday.Rearanged for translationIboughtbookinterestingthisyesterdayVietnamese translationTôimuaquyển sáchthú vịnàyhôm qua

We’ve learned in the [lesson on Nouns](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-nouns/) that _this_ is positioned after the nouns it modifies in Vietnamese. Now, with the presence of adjectives, the adjective and the noun forms a noun phrase and _này_(“this”) is therefore put after the adjective. So, a small formula to summarise this is:

#### Position of Adjectives in Vietnamese

[Measure word](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-nouns/#measure-words) \+ Noun + Adjectives + _này_(“this”)/ _kia_(“that”)

Let’s now capitalise on this knowledge about positions of adjectives to translate the phrase _this book cover_. Given that _cover_ translates into _bìa_ and we have already known that _book_ translates into _sách_, _this_ translates into _này_, what’s your translation for the phrase?

If your translation is _sách bìa này_ or _quyển sách bìa này_ or the likes, I believe you understand the materials well so far although it’s not the correct answer yet. Let’s ask a couple of questions to clarify the translation process: what’s the main noun in this phrase? In other words, are we talking about book or cover? It’s _cover_, right? Then we need to find out the measure word for this principal noun. It’s _cái_.

The next question: _book_ functions like an adjective in that it modifies the main noun _cover_, doesn’t it? Then, our formula right above gives us the following translation:

Translation:

Measure word“cover”“book”“this”Cáibìasáchnày

Everything is clear so far? …Let’s move on to talk about inflections on adjectives.

### Inflections on Vietnamese Adjectives

One of the most interesting aspect of adjectives in English is that they can change meaning through inflections.

For example, the adjective _happy_ can be negated by adding the prefix _un-_ to form the negative-meaning word _unhappy_; the meaning of _honest_ can be reverted through the use of the prefix _dis-_ to form _dishonest_.

In Vietnamese, however, this is not possible for adjectives, and other types of words as well.

But there should be no issue with translating _unhappy_ into Vietnamese as we can simply translate it as _not happy_.

How about transforming adjectives into nouns, as in the noun _happiness_, which is derived by adding the suffix -ness to the adjective _happy?_

As there is no inflection whatsoever on Vietnamese words, we can’t apply a similar transformation. The way to make adjectives become nouns in Vietnamese is to add in front of them an appropriate “adj-to-noun” transformers such as _niềm_, _nỗi_, _sự_, etc. In our example, the word for _happy_ is _niềm_ so that _happiness_ is translated into _niềm hạnh phúc_.

To clarify the role of these transformers, consider the following mapping:

niềmhạnh phúc-nesshappy

This table clarifies that transformers such as “niềm”, “nỗi”, “cái”, “điều”, “sự”, … by themselves don’t have any meaning. They only transform the following word into the correct part-of-speech to follow the grammar.

The difficulty here is that you need to learn which “transformer” is used for which kinds of adjectives. The good news (or bad news?) is that for most of the cases, an adjective can accept many different “transformers”: so remembering one of them will do.

How about the suffix _-ly_ that is added to many adjectives to make them become adverbs as in _happily_, _quickly_?

The answer is short and simple: no change is needed to make adjectives become adverbs in Vietnamese! That is to say that _hạnh phúc_(“happy”) can be used as both an adjective (“happy”) and an adverb (“happily”).

### Summary

In this lesson, we’ve got to know the followings about Vietnamese adjectives:

- Adjectives are put after the nouns they modify. As a corollary, phrases of multiple nouns are translated into Vietnamese in reverse order.
- To make adjectives become nouns, add their appropriate “transformers” such as _sự_, _niềm_. Adjectives in Vietnamese also function as adverbs.
