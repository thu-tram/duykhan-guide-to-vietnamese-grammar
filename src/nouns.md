Vietnamese nouns – YourVietnamese
===================================

So we have learned in the [overview about Vietnamese grammar](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/sentence-structure/) that it has the same Subject + Verb + Object (SVO) sentence structure as English. If you haven’t gone through that lesson, it’s highly recommended you read it before proceeding with this lesson because you can find there the big picture of Vietnamese Grammar as well as the most important differences from English.

The grammar of Vietnamese nouns is plain and simple. There is no singular and plural form: _pen_ in _two pen_ has the same form as _pen_ in _one pen_: no adding of suffix – _s_ whatsoever.

### Vietnamese Measure words

In English, we know that there are countable nouns, which can be counted such as pens and books, and uncountable nouns, which are uncountable such as water, air. For countable nouns, we simply use them directly, and with numbers when needed, as in _I have 2 books_. On the other hand, as uncountable nouns such as _water_ can’t be counted, we need to use “containers” such as “glass” or “bottle” for _water_.

In Vietnamese, we’ll use “containers” for uncountable nouns as in English. However, for countable nouns, we also need to put in front of them a type of words known as _measure words_ or _classifiers_. To illustrate this, let’s take the simple sentence: _I have a book_. Its direct word-by-word Vietnamese translation is _Tôi_(“I”) _có_(“have”) _một_(“a”) _sách_(“book”)”.

If you use the above direct translation _Tôi có một sách_, native speakers would still completely understand what you mean. In addition, they’d also know that you are…still learning the Vietnamese Grammar! Here, even though _book_ is a countable noun, we still need to use its measure word, which is _quyển_. The correct translation is thus: _Tôi có một quyển sách_.

The reason why every (countable) noun in Vietnamese needs a measure word is that nouns alone without their measure words carry an abstract meaning. For example, _sách_, without its measure word _quyển_, arouses a general abstract notion, similar to what the plural form _books_ does to English speakers. Its measure word has the effect of “concretize” that abstract meaning into a specific book instance, which is countable.

This explains why in _Reading books is a very effective way of learning_, the Vietnamese translation of _books_ is just _sách_, without its measure word since we are not talking about any particular book but just books in general. In English, to refer to such a general notion, we normally use plural nouns. In Vietnamese, this is expressed by using nouns without their measure words: givent that _read_ translates into _đọc_, the phrase _reading books_ in our example is therefore translated to _đọc sách_, not _đọc quyển sách_.

About counting using numbers, how do you translate _I have two books_ given that _hai_ is the translation of _two_? Yes, it’s _Tôi có hai quyển sách_. From this example, we see that measure words should be put closer to their nouns than numbers. Indeed, there is no type of word that can separate a noun and its measure word!

We have seen one measure word: _quyển_ for _sách_(“book”). You can find the most common measure words and their brief usage in the following list.

The common measure words:

- cái/chiếc: for most inanimate objects. When both are interchangeable, “chiếc” is more formal.
- con: for animals and children.
- bài: for songs, drawings, poems, essays and the likes.
- câu: for sentential units of verses, lyrics, quotes.
- cây: for stick-like objects such as umbrella, sticks.
- quả/trái: for round-shape objects such as fruits.
- quyển/cuốn: for book-type objects: book, magazine.
- tờ: for sheets of paper or newspaper.
- lá: for smaller sheets of paper such as letters, cards.

That’s about it for measure words. There are quite a couple of them so it may takes you some time. Beyond that, please take note of the point about the absence of measure words when expressing general notions.

The next section introduces the commonly used articles (“a”, “an”, “the”) and demonstratives (“this”, “that”, “these”, “those”)

### Articles and Demonstratives

It’s commonly acknowledged that _a_/ _an_ and _the_ are among the words(to be more precise, _articles_) that are used extensively in English. And the same holds true for the demonstrative determiners _this_, _that_, _these_ and _those_. This is the reason why it would probably be good to know how to translate them into Vietnamese.

As a quick recap, the two words _a_ and _an_ are used in English to refer to a singular and indefinite noun, a noun which has not been clearly specified or previously mentioned as in _I have a grammar book_. The word _the_ is just the opposite, referring to definite nouns. In Vietnamese, it’s generally the case that _a_ or _an_ is translated to _một_, which is actually the literal translation of _one_; and _the_ is either translated to _này_ or _kia_, which are the literal translations of _this_ and _that_ in that order, or it’s dropped completely.

I haveagrammar book.Tôi cómộtquyển sách ngữ pháp.

This Vietnamese way of translating _a_/ _an_ to “một” is actually not too peculiar since we could have written the example English sentence using _one_ instead of _a_: _I have one grammar book_ although the use of _one_ may lead to a slight change of emphasis.

Let’s now shift our focus to _the_ with this example: _I have just bought a book. The book is about learning foreign languages_. As you can see, the second mention of book is qualified by _the_ thanks to its first mention in the previous sentence. The translation of _the book_ in the second sentence is _quyển sách đó_. Let’s analyse this translation snippet in more details:

As indicated in the table, _đó_ is the translation of _that_. In Vietnamese, there is no direct equivalent of _the_ and in order to express the definiteness of an object we would instead use _this_, _that_, _these_ or _those_. You might have also noticed that _đó_ is put after the noun _sách_, which is a general rule. As a quick exercise, given that _this_ translates to _này_, how do you translate the phrase _this book_ into Vietnamese? Well, the translation process in slow motion goes like this: _this book_ –\> _book this_ —\> _quyển sách này_. Feeling okay? Just a bit more and you would become a master of Vietnamese nouns.

It’s proper time we give an example in which _the_ needs no translation. Consider the sentence _The weather is sunny today_ (and of course, you’re feeling happy :). In English, there is no doubt that we need _the_ with _weather_. In Vietnamese, however, there is no grammatical requirementfor an equivalent of _the_: _weather_ alone is the correct way. Similarly, the translation of _the sun_ in _the sun rises in the east_ is just _mặt trời_(“sun”).

Last but not least, the translation of _these_ and _those_ are slightly less easy than those of _this_ and _that_. Recall that _this book_ is translated into the order _book this_. The phrase _these books_ is not translated simply in the order _books these_ because there is no one-word direction translation of _these_. The correct translation of _these_ is _Những … này_ wherethe the 3 dots is the place of nouns. As such, _these books_ is translated into _những (quyển sách) này_. By the way, can you recall where did you see the word _này_? If you say it’s the translation of _this_: well-done!

The translation of _those_ is _Những … đó_. Do you find anything in common? The word _những_? Yes, it’s the word encoding plurality in our translations.

### Pronouns

We’ve briefly discussed “subject pronouns”, which include _I_, _You_, _He_/ _She_, etc. in English. The only difficulty in using subject pronouns in Vietnamese that there is no single translation of, for example, _I_ and the correct one to use varies with the situation. An in-depth discussion on the various ways of usage for subject pronouns can be found at [\[2\]](#ref2).

Examples of “object pronouns” include _me_, _you_, _him_, _her_, etc. In Vietnamese, this is simple: the same word is used for both _I_ and _me_! In other words, subject and object pronouns are the same in Vietnamese.

Possessive pronouns in English refer to such words as _my_, _your_, _his_, _her_, etc. The Vietnamese equivalents are given below:

mycủa tôiyourcủa bạnhiscủa anhhercủa cô

The important difference is that while possessive pronouns are put in front of nouns in English, they are put after nouns in Vietnamese. Consider the following example:

Example:

Đâylàquyển sáchcủa tôiThisisbookmy

The literal English translation of _của tôi_ is _of me_ so that the way to say _This is my book_ in Vietnamese is to say _This is the book of me_. The only note here is that because there are different ways to translate _me_, there are different ways to translate _of me_ or _my_.

That’s about it for possessive pronouns. Let’s summarise what we’ve learned in this short lesson:

### Summary

In this lesson on Vietnamese nouns, we’ve gone through the following important aspects:

- There is no plural form of nouns: only one form for both singular and plural meanings.
- Nouns, whether countable or not, require the use of measure words in front of them. When used in the abstract sense, measure words are not used.
- _This_ and _that_ are put after the nouns they modify. _These_ and _Those_ are translated into _Những …_ \+ _này_/ _kia_,respectively.
- The way to express _my book_ in Vietnamese is _book of me_.
