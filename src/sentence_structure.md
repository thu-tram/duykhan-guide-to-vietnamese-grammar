Vietnamese basic grammar: sentence structure – YourVietnamese
===============================================================

The [Introduction to Vietnamese Language](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-language-introduction/) has introduced you the most important characteristics of the language as a whole. In this very first lesson of the Express Grammar Course, we would learn _the most important grammatical features of Vietnamese Language_, especially when compared with English.

## Vietnamese Sentence Structure

In this section, we’ll learn how Vietnamese words are arranged to form meaning. Let’s get started with the classical example: _I love you_. How is that expressed in Vietnamese? It’s _Anh yêu em_. Let’s see the break-downs:

Example:

VietEnglishAnhIt means: _I_, also implying that you’re older or more senior.

In Vietnamese, we’ll use different words for _I_, depending on our relationship with the listener (whether we are older or more senior). The specific word choice also varies with different regions of Vietnam.

YêuThis means: _love_.EmThe word means: _you_. This word implies that you are younger, less senior. ( [More on pronouns](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-pronouns/))

Please don’t remember all the details above, it’s just for reading purpose. What should be remembered, however, is this:

#### Vietnamese Grammar Rule 1

Vietnamese Language has the same sentence structure as English:

Subject + Verb + Object (or SVO for short).

Did you see it? _Anh_(“I”: Subject) + _yêu_(“love”: Verb) + _em_(“you”: Object). This is one of the most fundamental rules of Vietnamese grammar, or of any language for that matter. The next time you learn a new language, it’s good to ask from the very beginning: what’s the basic sentence structure of this language? (For a language with a different sentence structure, Japanese is a good example).

## Position of Vietnamese Adverbs

Now, let’s try to add some more romance to this sentence. How about _I love you a lot_? The Vietnamese equivalent is _Tôi yêu em nhiều_. The first part remains the same and the added part is _nhiều_ for _a lot_: _a lot_ <–\> _nhiều_. And this gives us a general rule about position of adverbs (eg. often, fast, beautifully):

#### Vietnamese Grammar Rule 2

In Vietnamese, as in English, adverbs are positioned after the verbs they modify.

In English, some adverbs, such as _rather_, are positioned before the verb as in this sentence: _I rather like it_. This is also the case in Vietnamese and indeed, the translation of that sentence is: _Anh(I) khá(rather) thích(like) nó(it)_.

The other rule is that if verbs require objects, adverbs are then positioned after the objects, as in English. As we don’t say _I love a lot you_ in English, we don’t say _Anh yêu nhiều em_ (\*). The correct Vietnamese translation is _Anh yêu em nhiều_. The sentence structure we have learned so far is then: Subject + Verb (+ Object) + Adverbs.

Example:

In factyouareverybeautifulQuả thậtem_No translation needed_rấtđẹp

Apart from the absence of the translation of the verb _to be_, this is almost a direct one-to-one word mapping from English to Vietnamese. How similar Vietnamese is to English! Don’t you think so? The absence of the translation of the verb _to be_ is explained in the following rule:

#### Vietnamese Grammar Rule 3

In Vietnamese, adjectives don’t go with _to be_.

No _to be_ with adjectives? Yes, so the Vietnamese way of saying _She’s beautiful_ is simply _She beautiful_!

The astute readers would then ask: Then, how do we change it to a question: there is no _to be_ to be inverted to the front of the sentence as in English! That’s a really good question and the answer is that we’ll use a question marker combined with a rising in intonation to express questions in Vietnamese. This way of asking questions is shared by Chinese and French as well.

We’ve learned about verbs, adverbs and adjectives. Now, we’ll conclude this overview of Vietnamese Grammar with the usage of nouns through another compliment: _You have a very beautiful voice_. What’s the Vietnamese translation? Let’s first break this English sentence into its major components:

_You_(Subject) + _have_(Verb) + _a very beautiful voice_(Object). We’ve learned above that Vietnamese also shares the same Subject + Verb + Object (or SVO) ordering. So how does the sentence structure of the Vietnamese translation look like? Yes, it’s the same!

Translation mapping:

Youhavea very beautiful voiceEmcómột giọng nói rất hay.

Let’s take a closer look at the translation of the phrase _very beautiful voice_: _giọng nói rất hay_.

giọng nóirất hayvoicevery beautiful

As you can observe, the phrase _rất hay_(“very beautiful”) is positioned after _giọng nói_(“voice”), which is different from English. And this gives us another general rule:

#### Vietnamese Grammar Rule 4

In Vietnamese, adjectives are positioned after the nouns they modify.

Another observation that you might have had is that the adverb of intensity _very_ is positioned before the adjective _beautiful_: _rất_(“very”) _đẹp_(“beautiful”), as in English. This is aslo a general rule: adverbs are put before adjectives they modify, just as in English. For instance, _She is very smart_ would translate into _Cô ta rất thông minh._ Note that _rất (very)_ occurs before the adjective _thông minh (smart)_.

Now, let’s review what we’ve learned by translating this snippet _You are very beautiful_. Let’s go very slowly, though I know that you can do it much faster, to make it very sure that everything is clear and in order.

_You_ \+ _are_(“to be”) + _very_(adverb) + _beautiful_(adjective). The phrase _very beautiful_ is an adjectival phrase consisting of the main adjective _beautiful_ and the adverb of intensity _very_. The Vietnamese translation of this phrase, as we’ve already discussed, has the same order of: _rất_(“very”) + _đẹp_(“beautiful”).

We’ve also learned that adjectives in Vietnamese aren’t accompanied by _to be_. Therefore, the Vietnamese version would be _You very beautiful_. Putting everything together, we reach the correct translation: _Em rất đẹp_. If you got it right, congratulations!

That’s enough for an overview. I hope you have enjoyed the reading and learning so far.

## Summary

We’ve quickly gone through the most important points in Vietnamese Grammar in this overview. The take-away points are:

- Vietnamese is similar to English in the general sentence structure, which is: Subject + Verb (+ Object) + Adverbs.
- In Vietnamese, as in English, adverbs are put after the verbs they modify.
- In Vietnamese, adjectives aren’t prefixed with _to be_.
- In Vietnamese, adjectives are positioned after the nouns they modify.

You would probably now agree that Vietnamese and English Grammar are very similar. The last two points about adjectives in the summary list above are two of the (few) most significant grammatical differences. Everything else can be assumed to be the same for now.
