What is a tag question and how does it work in Vietnamese? It's actually very simple! Watch this video of Lan explaining how you ask questions like "You're Lan, aren't you?" in Vietnamese.

We've made a series of Making Questions in Vietnamese on our Youtube channel. Check them out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUEK2O_89s&list=PLpDgPu_Hq9ZwvzJLu388a5uYFpxMYyeMs).
