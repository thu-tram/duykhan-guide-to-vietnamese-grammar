Vietnamese Adverbs – YourVietnamese
=====================================

This lesson introduces you to the most common usages of _Vietnamese adverbs_. As their primary role is to modify [verbs](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese-grammar/verbs-in-vietnamese/) and [adjectives](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-adjectives/), this lesson on adverbs builds upon the knowledge of Vietnamese verbs and adjectives presented in previous lessons. It helps a lot if you read this lesson only after going through those lessons.

### Position of Vietnamese adverbs

We’ll begin with 2 examples to demonstrate that the use of adverbs in Vietnamese is very similar to its English use.

Example:

ShesingswellCô ấyháthayI want to learnVietnamesefastTôi muốn họctiếng Việtnhanh

As you can observe, the positions of the adverbs _hay_(“well”) and _nhanh_(“fast”) are exactly the same as their English counterparts. In the first example, the adverb is positioned immediately after the verb _hát_(“sing”) as this verb requires no object. In the second example, as the verb _học_(“learn”) does take an object, which is _tiếng Việt_(“Vietnamese”), the adverb is put after the object, as in English.

The above adverbs are normally called “adverbs of manner” in that they add meaning in the aspect of “manner” to verbs they modify. There is another frequently-used group of adverbs known as “adverbs of frequency”, which include adverbs such as _often_, _frequently_ and _sometimes_. In English, the rule of thumb is that they are positioned after _to be_ and before other verbs. However, some of these adverbs such as _sometimes_ can be liberally positioned in front or at the end of the sentence.

The exact same thing happens for the case of Vietnamese. Let’s illustrate this with some examples:

Example:

Cô ấythườngthức dậy sớmSheusuallygets up earlyThỉnh thoảng,tôi thức dậy sớmSometimes,I get up earlyTôithỉnh thoảngthức dậy sớmIsometimesget up early

So many similarities, you must think! Indeed, that’s also the case with “adverbs of intensity” such as _very_, _really_. Let’s consider the following examples where they are used to modify adverbs and adjectives:

Example:

Cô ấy thức dậyrấtsớmShe gets upveryearlyCô ấy cómộtgiọng hátrấthayShe hasavoiceverybeautiful

In the first example, _rất_(“very”) precedes _sớm_(“early”) in exactly the way we would use in English. In the second example, the adverb _very_ is used to modify the adjective _beautiful_ and should therefore be thought of as “attached” to the adjective. In other words, _very beautiful voice_ is interpreted as consisting of the adjective phrase _very beautiful_ modifying the noun _voice_. As such, it comes as no surprise that in Vietnamese, the translation order would be “voice” + “very beautiful”, which yields “giọng hát” + “rất hay”. In both cases, _very_ is positioned before the the adjective or adverb it modifies, as in English.

### Vietnamese Muti-word adverbs

Everything on adverbs has been very familiar so far. And that’s indeed the general case. Before we end this lesson, let’s walk through one example where there is a small difference in the position of adverbs between Vietnamese and English.

Consider the adverb _incredible_ in _She sings incredibly well_ and _very_ in _She sings very well_. The two sentences are completely similar except for the choice of adverbs. The two sentences, therefore, share the exact same structure as expected. However, compare their Vietnamese translations below:

Example:

Cô ấy hátrấthayShe singsverywellCô ấy háthaykhông thể tin đượcShe singswellincredibly

As indicated above the phrase _không thể tin được_ is the Vietnamese translation of _incredibly_. According to what we’ve learned above, _incredibly well_ should translate into the order: “incredibly” + “well”, which should have produced “không thể tin được” + “hay”. Why the reverse here? Is this an exception?

The answer is yes, it’s an exception in that it doesn’t follow our general rule. Fortunately, this is not the type of exception that you should just learn by heart because there is a plausible explanation behind.

We know that translation of _incredibly_ is _không thể tin được_ whose word-by-word translation back to English is _can’t believe_ or _impossible to believe_. The fact that the Vietnamese translation of _incredibly_ is a phrase, not a word, is because the Vietnamese translation of the adjective “credible” is already a multi-word adjective: _có thể tin được_. There is no one-word adjective that means “credible” in Vietnamese. (Why? Please refer to Notes (\*) below for further discussion).

Now, if we look back at English and think about how we would use a multi-word phrase such as _to the extent that I can’t believe it_ to express _incredibly_. Do we still put the phrases in the position of _credibly_ to produce _She sings, to the extent that I can’t believe it, well_ or do we need to move this lengthy phrase to the end of the sentence? Suppose that we use another phrase: _I can’t believe that_, can we put it in the position of _credibly_ or do we have to put it in front? The same reason why _không thể tin được_ is put after _hay_(“well”): it appears to be a matter of pragmatics.

### Summary

It’s simple: When it comes to adverbs in Vietnamese, just use them how you normally do in English. The one caution is for Vietnamese multi-word adverbs, which are usually placed after the word(s) they modify.

#### Notes

(\*) For the curious learners who wants further explanations of why there is no one-word adjective in Vietnamese that means _credible_, the reason is possibly due to the fact that Vietnamese (and Chinese is another example) can be thought of as “compositional” in meaning. In other words, there usually isn’t a new word for a meaning that could have been expressed by combining meanings of existing words. In our example, the “existing word” is probably the verb _tin_(“believe”). The phrase “incredible” is then expressed by way of “impossible to believe”, which yields the multi-word translation _không thể tin được_.
