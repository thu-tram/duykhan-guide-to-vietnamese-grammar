Vietnamese conjunctions and negations – YourVietnamese
========================================================

We’ve gone through lessons on [Vietnamese nouns](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-nouns/), [Adjectives](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-adjectives/) then [Verbs](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-verbs/) and [Adverbs](https://yourvietnamese.com/learn-vietnamese/vietnamese-adverbs/). Those are the most fundamental building blocks of any sentence. In this last lesson of our express course on Vietnamese Grammar, we’ll _learn negation and conjunctions_.

### Negation

The way we Vietnamese saying no is also very similar to the English way. The equivalent of _not_ is _không_ in Vietnamese. To be specific, let’s consider the following example in which a verb is negated.

Verb negation:

Shedoesn’tread fastCô ấykhôngđọc nhanh

In the English negative sentence, we need to put _does not_ in front of the verb _read_. In the Vietnamese translation, we use the word _không_ in the place of _does not_. This word _không_ would be the main negation word for most cases.

Let’s take another example to see how adjectives are negated. Consider the following:

Negation of adjectives

The storyisn’tinterestingCâu chuyệnkhôngthú vị

Here, we again use _không_ in front of the adjective _thú vị_(“interesting”) to negate it.

The summary of this section?

#### Vietnamese Negation

Use _không_ in the place of _doesn’t_, _don’t_ or _isn’t_, _aren’t_, etc.

### Conjunctions

Now that we’re aware of most of the basic sentential constructs in Vietnamese, it seems appropriate to learn about conjunctions so that we can connect simple sentences into more complex ones.

Let’s begin with _and_, which connects ideas that support each other, and _but_, which contrasts opposite ideas. The equivalent of _and_ and _but_ in Vietnamese are _và_ and _nhưng_, respectively. Let illustrate their usage with the following two examples.

Examples of _and_ and _but_

I likethis colorandthat colorTôi thíchmàu nàyvàmàu kiaThis methodissimplebuteffectivePhương pháp nàyđơn giảnnhưnghiệu quả

We can observe in these two examples that _và_(“and”) and _nhưng_(“but”) are used exactly in the place of their English counterparts. In the first example, _and_ is used to connect two nouns while _but_ is used in the second example to connect two adjectives. Let’s look at an example where we use _and_ to connect two simple sentences:

Connecting simple sentences

His idea is greatandI really like itÝ tưởng của anh ta hayvàtôi thực sự thích nó

Here, the Vietnamese usage of _và_(“and”) is, again, totally similar to the English usage of _and_.

There is another frequently used conjunction: _or_, whose Vietnamese equivalent is _hay_, which share a very similar usage to _or_.

The related construct _either_… _or_ is expressed by the single word _hoặc_.

Below are a couple of examples to illustrate _hay_ and _hoặc_.

Example usages of _hay_ and _hoặc_

To conclude what we’ve just learned about Vietnamese conjunctions

#### Vietnamese Conjunctions

Use _và_(“and”), _nhưng_(“but”), _hay_(“or”), _hoặc_ (“either…or”)

the way you use them in English.
