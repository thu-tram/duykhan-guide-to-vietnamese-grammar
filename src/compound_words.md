## Compound words in Vietnamese

## **Definition**

A compound word consists of two or more words linked together. Each individual word must have its own meaning.

Example:

- giày dép (footwear) = giày (shoes) + dép (sandal) → Both of them refer to things that people wear on their feet.
- ba mẹ (parents) = ba (father) + mẹ (mother) → Both of them refer to family members.
- bánh sinh nhật (birthday cake) = bánh (a sweet food made with a mixture of flour, eggs, fat, and sugar) + sinh nhật (the day that is an exact year or number of years after a person was born).
- thầy cô (teacher) = thầy (a male teacher) + cô (a female teacher) → Both of them refer to how Vietnamese students address their teachers.

## **Classification**

### **Subordinate compound words**

This type consists of the main word and subordinate word modifying the main word. Normally, main words are placed before subordinate words and have wider meaning.

The meaning of a subordinate compound word is narrower than the meaning of the main word that makes it up.

Example:

- bà ngoại (maternal grandmother) = bà (the main word) + ngoại (the subordinate word)

We can make other subordinate compound words by combining the word “bà” with some other words, such as: bà nội (paternal grandmother), bà mụ (midwife), bà tôi (my grandmother), etc.

- xe máy (motorbike) = xe (the main word) + máy (the subordinate word)

We can make other subordinate compound words by combining the word “xe” with some other words, such as: xe lửa (train), xe hơi (car), xe bò (wagon), etc.

- hoa hồng (rose) = hoa (the main word) + hồng (the subordinate word)

We can make other subordinate compound words by combining the word “hoa” with some other words, such as: hoa hướng dương (sunflower), hoa cúc dại (daisy), hoa đào (blossom), etc.

- bút chì (pencil) = bút (the main word) + chì (the subordinate word)

We can make other subordinate compound words by combining the word “bút” with some other words, such as: bút bi (pen), bút lông (marker), bút màu (crayon), etc.

### **Coordinated compound words**

Coordinated compound words are words in which elements are equal in meaning. There is no distinction between the main and the subordinate word.

The meaning of a coordinated compound word is more general than the meaning of words that make it up.

Example:

**Vietnamese**

**English**

xóm làng

village

ao hồ

lake

đất nước

country

bàn ghế

furniture

ẩm ướt

wet

yêu thương

love

bút thước

stationery

bếp núc
